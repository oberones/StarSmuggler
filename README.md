# 🌌 Star Smuggler

**Star Smuggler** is an open-source, retro-futuristic trading and smuggling game inspired by the classic *Dope Wars*, 
set in a lawless corner of the galaxy. Take on the role of a daring space rogue as you barter, bribe, and blast your 
way across procedurally generated star systems in search of fortune and fame.

## 🚀 About the Game

You're not a villain. You're just trying to make a few credits running questionable cargo between distant worlds —
preferably without drawing the attention of planetary law enforcement or rival syndicates.


## 🧬 Features

- 📈 **Dynamic commodity prices**: Buy low, sell high—or hoard for a market crash.
- 💥 **Random encounters**: Pirates, patrols, traders, and strange anomalies.
- 🛠️ **Upgradeable ship and crew**: Customize your smuggling rig and hire specialists.
- ⌛ **Permadeath mode**: Risk it all in a single run for the highest profits.
- 🎮 **Built with MonoGame**: Cross-platform compatibility and extensibility.
